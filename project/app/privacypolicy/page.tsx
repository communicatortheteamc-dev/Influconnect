            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-[#000631]">🔒 No Returns or Refunds on Services</h2>
            <p>Once a service is agreed upon, confirmed, or initiated, InfluConnect does not offer refunds or returns under any circumstances, including but not limited to:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-gray-700">
                <li>Change of mind.</li>
               <li>Lack of usage</li>
               <li>Delayed delivery of required information from the client</li>
               <li>Expectations beyond the agreed scope of work</li>
               <li>Partial use of the service</li>
               <li>Client-side technical or operational issues</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All payments made toward our services are final and non-refundable.</p>
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-[#000631]">📝 Service Agreement</h2>
            <p>Before starting any project, clients receive a clear outline of the service details, including:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-gray-700">
                <li>Scope of work</li>
                <li>Deliverables</li>
                <li>Timelines</li>
                <li>Pricing</li>
                <li>Terms & conditions</li>
            </ul>
<p>Once the client approves and agrees to proceed, the service is considered accepted, and the refund/return policy applies.</p>
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-[#000631]">⚠️ Exceptions</h2>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
               Refunds or adjustments may be considered only in cases where InfluConnect fails to deliver the agreed service due to our own fault—not due to client-side delays or incomplete information.<br></br>
               Such cases will be evaluated solely at the discretion of InfluConnect.
